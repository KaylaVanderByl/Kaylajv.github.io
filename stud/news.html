<p id="newscap">Student activists take part in a four-day, 50-mile march from Madison to
  Janesville, Wisconsin - Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s hometown - to call
  for gun control. The idea for “March for Our Lives: 50 Miles More” came to a
  group of students at Shorewood High School - in a suburb of Milwaukee - as
  they were discussing ways to continue raising their voices on the issue of gun
  reform after Saturday’s national march.</p>

<p id="newscap">During the Oscars, Twitter ran a TV ad featuring the words of
  queer poet Denice Frohman alongside a series of women, including filmmaker
   Ava DuVernay and actress/producer Issa Rae.
“I heard a woman becomes herself the first time she speaks without permission,”
the ad begins. It finishes with the hashtag #HereWeAre.The campaign is intended
to spark positive conversation around the strength of women. </p>

  <p id="newscap">Victoria Tauli-Corpuz is a tiny woman who’s used to standing up to power.
A lifelong rights activist who is now the United Nations special rapporteur for the rights
of indigenous peoples, her job is to hold governments accountable for violations.  For years,
 she has traveled the world to hear the grievances of indigenous people and press for their
 rights at the highest levels.
Each time, after a week or two on the road, she has returned home to the Philippines.
These days, though, Ms. Tauli-Corpuz is feeling rattled. The president of her country,
 Rodrigo Duterte, has included her on a list of suspected terrorists.
Fearing for her safety, she left home. For two months, the 65-year-old grandmother has
 been hopping from city to city with just one suitcase in tow. </p>
