<h1 id="head">MUSIC - INTERVIEW</h1>

<h1 id="NAOarticle"id="hindphone">HINDS</h1>
<img id="hind1"src="images/22.jpg">
<h1 id="hindopening">The one thing that binds the four members of Hinds–Carlotta Cosials
  (vocals, guitar), Ana Perrote (vocals, guitar), Ade Martin (bass), and
  Amber Grimbergen (drums)–is love. Love is what moves them; it’s what their
   music revolves around, and it’s what they live by. Both individually and
   collectively, they believe in loving passionately and without permission–forget
    social standards, contracts, or distance.</h1>

<h1 id="hindquote">All four musicians have learned different lessons about love, and have shared
   these insights with one another, for support and creative fuel. Ade and Carlotta
    (who is madly in love with her best friend from college) choose love every day,
     putting in the effort to strengthen their relationships despite long distances
      and schedule conflicts. Ana is learning to be single again after a failed relationship,
       and Amber is shaking off disappointment, hoping she falls in love for the first time when it’s right.</h1>

<h2 id="hindq">What does love mean to you?</h2>
<p id="hindtext"> Amber: Love is something that feels good, something that completes you, something to
   learn about. I think love keeps teaching you things, and that’s beautiful. I don't really
    think I’ve ever been in love. I would love to be in love, but I don't really look for it.
    It’s also hard to fall for someone when you’re always touring.

<br><br>Ana: Love moves everything. One of my favorite lyrics goes: Where you invest your love, you
invest your life. To me, that’s how it all functions with who you love, whether it be a boyfriend,
girlfriend, friend, or family. Where you invest your love, or who you give your love to, is where
 the roots of your future are sprouting from. If I’m investing my time and heart in something,
 that means I’m investing my life in it.

<br><br>Carlotta: Love makes everything. I’m the kind of person that loves the sensation of being in
love, of being in a relationship, having someone to give everything to. Someone to share your
life with is a plus. You’re almost living two lives; all the things that make him happy make you happy too.</p>
<img id="hind3"src="images/h2.jpg">

<h2 id="hindq2">Where or from whom did you learn about love?</h2>
<p id="hindtext2">Ade: I understood love properly through my parents. My dad moved to Vietnam
   [for] six years because of work. My mom lives in Madrid. They see each other twice a year
   [in person], but she wakes up every single day, and while she’s having breakfast they Skype.
    I’ve seen them love this way since I was a teenager. Three or four years ago, I didn’t
    understand it. I asked, “If you’re not together, why are you still together? I don’t get it.”
She said that I was the most important thing to her, so she didn’t move. They’re probably struggling,
but they taught me that if you want it, you find a way. With my boyfriend now, I make time. Even if I’m
 so tired I feel like I’m going to die, even if it’s for two minutes or 20 minutes, I make time.


<br><br>Amber: My grandparents really made me think about love. Seeing how time keeps going and they were loving
 each other like the first day. Unfortunately, I think I’ve never experienced a thing like that yet.


<br><br>Carlotta: The most important things about love I learned from my mother. My parents are separated, but
she still believes in love for your whole life. There’s a saying in Spanish we follow–Amor para todo la
 vida (Love for the rest of your life). Even after a complication as huge as separation or divorce, she
 still believes in that saying, and in love. She just got married again. We actually played in the wedding.
  It’s cool to have hope in love.</p>
  <img id="hind4"src="images/h3.jpg">
  <h2 id="hindq3">What’s something you learned from your most recent relationship?</h2>
  <p id="hindtext">Carlotta: My ex-boyfriend was a musician before I was a musician.
    He couldn’t stand it. He started to be super mean to me because I was in Hinds. I was like,
     “I don’t think you even like me. You look at me and say you love me, but you don’t even like me.”
     He didn’t have an answer to that.
<br>Our relationship had two different phases. It started with me kissing the ground he stepped on.
I was like a groupie, more or less. It wasn’t reciprocated at all. Then suddenly, I started to be very
 busy with Hinds so I didn’t have all the time I used to. The relationship started to shift. It’s
  disgusting to think back now that I have perspective. The other day I found an old diary. I opened
   to the first page, [and] there was a sentence that killed me. [It read], “My boyfriend has been
   weird with me, as always.” I read that and thought, I was like that since 2013. How long have
   I been trying? I’ve been trying all this time.
<br>At the end of our relationship, he said I was the love of his life and he always imagined having
children with me. I asked, “Why didn’t you act like that?” He said he was secure of my love so he
could treat me like that. You have to treat me right because you love treating me right, not because
you’re scared I’ll leave. It’s not a responsibility, it’s something you want to do.</p>

           There’s tranquility in knowing that you’re your own person, with or without someone.”<br> - Ana</h1>
