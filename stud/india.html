<h1 id="NAOarticle"id="indiaphone">INDIA SHAWN</h1>
<h1 id="indiaopening">“I'm comin’ up Lord, although my burdens sometime they
  press me down, but if I can only keep this faith I’ll have strength just to
   run this race; I’m lookin’ for my starry crown.” — “Rough Side of the Mountain”
    <br>by Rev. F.C. Barnes</h1>
    <img id="indiaphone2"src="images/india.jpg">
    <p id="indiatext">The Georgia elevation where the Ku Klux Klan was
       reborn in 1915 and that played host to a pro-Confederate flag rally in July of this
       year has somehow managed to become something for everyone. For families visiting
       from every country, it’s a nice tourist attraction. For workout warriors of every age,
       it’s a challenging hike and run. For people of every color who are just stressed the fuck out,
        it’s a calming meditation space. For being such a massive immovable object, Stone Mountain is
        pretty fluid.
<br>But on this misty late-summer morning, fluidity isn’t its strong suit.
Rain from the night before and overcast skies have made this place a slippery slope.
The climb to the top is doable, if you’ve got the right footwear and your senses are keen.
However, if you're trying to walk up this wet mountain with worn soles and extra baggage, you’re busting your ass. Repeatedly.
</p>

<p id="indiatext2">Singer-songwriter India Shawn has made this hike before, and she knows what the summit looks like.
   Even though she admits that patience isn’t her strongest virtue, she appears to be in no real rush
    to get there. If she walks too fast she may miss something, whether it be a bird to observe or a
    twig in the path to avoid. But she also knows that if she walks too slow the hike will become
    more agonizing with every step, eventually making her consider stopping and turning around.
“Yes, my legs are killing me,” she laughs, with a sigh right after. She’s been in the gym doing weight
 training and yesterday was leg day. The discomfort can be viewed as a test of will and strength.
 Or it can be a sign to go sit your ass down somewhere. <br />But with the heavy rains looking like
 they want an encore, sitting in puddles or walking downhill in a storm are not options. Plus, she isn’t
 out here alone. She has her manager, Paris “PK” Kirk, and a small camera crew in tow, all of whom woke up
 at 4:30 in the morning just for her. India isn’t stuck in the rain yet, but she can’t turn back either.</p>

<p id="indiatext3">Raised in West Covina, Calif., India grew up the youngest of four in a single-parent household.
  Her mother worked as a medical transcriber and moonlighted as the praise and worship leader at their
  church. When India was turning 16 years old, the family got bored with L.A. and decided to move down South.
“We packed up everything, sold a lot of stuff, hopped on a plane and left,” says India. “It was really random.”
Shawn landed in Atlanta in 2004, during the height of the crunk era. Her new classmates at North Springs High
School all dressed like extras for a Crime Mob video; guys in tall tees to their knees, girls in dresses way above
theirs. Although India and her family were now calling Georgia home, the events that followed were straight out of
a Hollywood script.<br>
Just months after settling in, India was walking through a Best Buy parking lot singing to herself (Mya,
“Fallen,” if you were wondering). She was singing just loud enough to be overheard by a guy who offered to
take her to a studio and record. She accepted, and that night, he introduced her to the man who became her
first manager. They hit the ground running.</p>

    <p id="indiatext4">Instead of being in class, India was in and out of studio sessions and label meetings.
       While her classmates were trying to find reasons to leave school early, she had real reasons to do so,
        like singing the national anthem at Georgia State basketball games.
“My high school career was a blur,” admits India. “I don’t even think I have a picture in my senior year yearbook.”<br>
Despite all her extracurriculars, India did finish high school and enrolled at Georgia State in 2006 to study
sociology and non-profits. Still balancing her budding career with school, India formed a three-woman
songwriting team named Full Circle with her sister Jazmyn Michel and friend Kesia Hollins. In moving around,
the trio forged a working relationship with producer Hit-Boy and began writing reference tracks to his beats.
 Hit-Boy took what he was hearing to his boss at the time, hitmaker Polow Da Don. Impressed by what he heard,
 he signed India and her squad to a publishing deal with his company, Zone 4, through Universal. With a road to
  riches and fame looking like it was laid out right in front of her, India quit college and moved back to Los Angeles.<br>
India found herself in studios working with and writing songs for Diddy and Dirty Money, M.I.A., Monica and
Chris Brown. She was in the studio with Dr. Dre coming up with hooks for the Detox album that’s never coming out.
But even with the high profile placements, she didn’t like the feeling of neglecting her own music.
“I really didn’t like that time of providing the service of songwriting,” she says. “When you’re writing for other
 artists, you are providing a service until people want your style. I didn’t like that I couldn’t have as much input.”<br>
There was one time when she did have input, but not the kind she liked. Budding pop princess Keri Hilson was
going for some edge with her 2010 sophomore album No Boys Allowed, and India, by way of her pub deal with
Zone 4, was enlisted to write on it. She lent her pen to the album’s most controversial song “The Way
You Love Me.” Lines like, “Fuck me, fuck me, it’s the way you fuck me,” and “I got the kind of pussy that
 will keep you off the streets,” raised eyebrows, considering the source. The accompanying glam porn-ish
  video sought to raise a little more. To date, the video has 15 million views on Vevo, but Vevo doesn’t
  surface the number of those views that happened on mute. Which is fine by India.</p>
  <h1 id="indiaquote2">“I really didn’t like that time of providing the service of songwriting.”</h1>
  <p id="indiatext5">“I don’t talk about it,” says India, whose publishing company's
     name is Nuns With Attitude, a name given to her by Dr. Dre. “I’m not a prude, but
     that song, I wasn’t in love with. Something didn’t sit well with me. I didn’t even want
     credit for it.”<br>
India is taking credit for her most recent EP, Outer Limits, though. Co-written
with and entirely produced by James Fauntleroy, the album’s been labeled “experimental R&B,”
but it infuses everything from dance to folk. There are songs about mermaids and hooks that borrow
 from Ron Burgundy quotes. There are lyrics you’ll find yourself singing along with the second time
 you hear them, and there are others you may have to look up on Genius to decipher. This is R&B
 music that makes you want to think and feel, not just drink and fuck.<br>
“Sometimes I just want to write a dumb ass song that’s the biggest song on the radio,” says Shawn.
 “But I have this thing in me that says ‘No, that’s not for you.’ Maybe that makes me who I am.”
“I actually care about what my family thinks. Maybe that’s a bad thing. I have that little voice inside me:
‘Are you going to be able to take this to your mom?’ I don’t want to be embarrassed about anything, I want to be proud.”</p>
